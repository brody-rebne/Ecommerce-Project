## About

Snackmeister is a storefront app for selling various types of (mostly) healthy snacks. The web app is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Razor Pages, and Razor views. The backend is written in C# using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and using the MVC framework.

We capture user identities via ASP.NET's built-in identity handling services. Users are registered with a claim captured containing their birthdate to allow for use in future promotional offers. This claim is captured in the registration logic.
